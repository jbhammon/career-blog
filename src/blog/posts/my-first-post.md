Like I wrote on the home page, this site is about my work as a web developer.

I wanted to make this site as lightweight as possible and learn some new tools while making it. I used a the static site generator [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) and have been loving it so far. It's refreshing to use a tool without as much overhead as SPA frameworks tend to have.

I also deployed this site with Netlify and was pretty pleased with that as well. The whole process of connecting the Netlify site/app to my Github repo was pretty painless and definitely something I'll consider using again for projects like this in the future.

Styles: Tailwind + Every Layout! More to come here.

This is a first, and simple, blog post to get this section started. I'm not sure that I want to commit time to writing and publishing ideas from my worklife, but if I do it'll happen here.
